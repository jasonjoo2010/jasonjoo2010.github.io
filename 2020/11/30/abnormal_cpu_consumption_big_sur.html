        <h1 id="toc_0">Background</h1>
<p>I upgraded to Big Sur several days ago. There were still some annoying issues under Catalina after several releases. For instance the <code>Mail.app</code> may occupy over 200% CPU and its memory consumption keep raising. I have seen it consumed about 35GB of memory. And the conditions causing it are unknown. I have tried even reimport all the mails. To take a rest from keeping attention on its memory consumption I wrote a cron job to do monitoring. It ran every 5 minutes and would kill it if it consumed more than 2 GB memory. When I saw the dot of Mail.app in the dock disappeared I knew that it was killed on the way of out of control. It&#39;s a tricky solution.</p>
<p>So when I saw the new release called Big Sur I thought of the risk for a while. I really wanted my Mail.app issue solved but no more nasty bugs. Finally I did the upgrading.</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">After Upgrading</h1>
<p>Upgrading process cost me about an hour and be honestly I don&#39;t like the new style of UI which makes me feeling like my 2015mid MBP turns to be an iPad pro.</p>
<p>But anyway it&#39;s amazing the Mail.app issue seems disappeared after recreating all my mail accounts(There was still a long way before this). But something was wrong that the fan just didn&#39;t stop for a while, kept working hard. I opened the monitor and found <code>secd</code> process consume 100% CPU.</p>
<p>Life is too hard for me.</p>
<p>Details can be reached <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252054223?login=true">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="toc_2">Temporary Workaround</h1>
<p>Instead trying to relogin my iCloud account I made a temporary workaround. I wrote another cron job to kill <code>cloudd</code> periodically which makes it easier waiting a new release of Big Sur.</p>
<p>My script is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span class="nv">PID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>pgrep -u <span class="nv">$UID</span> ^cloudd$<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;no</span><span class="nv">$PID</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;no&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">exit</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="nb">kill</span> <span class="nv">$PID</span>

sleep <span class="m">30</span>
<span class="nv">PID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>pgrep -u <span class="nv">$UID</span> ^cloudd$<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;no</span><span class="nv">$PID</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;no&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
        <span class="nb">exit</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="nb">kill</span> <span class="nv">$PID</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Save it to your home directory (eg. <code>~/check_cloudd</code>) and grant it executable by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chmod +x ~/check_cloudd
</pre></div>
<p>You can add it into your cron by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>crontab -e
</pre></div>
<p>and take this for reference (use your own path)</p>

<pre><code>* * * * * ~/check_cloudd</code></pre>
<p>It will kill <code>cloudd</code> every 30 seconds.</p>

<h1 id="toc_3">Final Shot</h1>
<p>The temporary solution worked for about ten days. But in a morning it doesn&#39;t work anymore. When <code>cloudd</code> restarted it ran into heavy load immediately. And there still haven&#39;t existed a new release yet.</p>
<p>So I gave up and logged out my <code>Apple ID</code> finally. Restarted OSX, waited it be stable, relogged in my Apple ID and clean all duplicated copy of data like iCloud Drive, etc. .</p>
<p>Everything seems back to normal which should be verified by days in future.</p>
