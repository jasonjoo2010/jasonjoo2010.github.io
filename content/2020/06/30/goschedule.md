# Introduction

We have some distributed jobs which is scheduled between different application processes (nodes). So how to make them high available and well balanced is important. In Java we have [tbschedule](https://jasonjoo2010.github.io/2019/07/31/tbschedule.html) and we also have some applications in GoLang.

So this is a distributed scheduling library in GoLang like tbschedule in Java.
